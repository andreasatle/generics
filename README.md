### Generics in go

A new golang environment (dev.go2go) was downloaded and compiled.

In order to run the code:
```
go tool go2go run <file.go2>
```

The point is to try out the generics in go that might be introduced in go 1.17.

I basically try to implement some code that appears in the "Type Parameters - Draft Desgn", https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md.

This project is purely educational, and not intended to be useful (at this point). Once generics are introduced in the language, this project will be revisited and re-factored.
